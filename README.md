I wanted to use Bootstrap classes to keep the food items in a row while in fullscreen and upon shrinking the page it would be resized into a column. I made sure to give each column 12 units and gave a different color to each background while also keeping a consistent theme. As for the food images I used the img-fluid Bootstrap class to make sure that when the rows/columns are resized, that the images are as well. When resized, the images and rows are resized into columns to be viewed for better visibility.
